# MyVibe

MyVibe is a jailbreak tweak that disables vibrate when your phone is placed on a flat surface.

MyVibe was originally available in the Cydia Store for $1.99 but is now available for free.

# Compatibility

MyVibe is compatible with iOS 6 through 7.1.x.

# Why Did I Open-Source This?

As much as I would like to, I don't have the time or energy to continue updating this tweak. I'm open-sourcing it with the hope that someone else will. I'm happy to accept pull requests and submit new updates to Cydia.

**PLEASE DO NOT UPLOAD THIS TO ANY CYDIA REPOSITORIES WITHOUT MY PERMISSION.**

# Known Issues

iOS 8 changed a lot with regards to preferences. The tweak works well on iOS 8 with the exception of reading the initial values of the vibrate state from Springboard's preferences. I spent a bit of time trying to find a workaround, but gave up.

# Why Is This Code So Bad?

I started writing this tweak very early on in my jailbreak tweak career. And to make matters worse, it's non-ARC code.
